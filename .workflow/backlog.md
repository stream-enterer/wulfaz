## Pending (threshold not yet met)

- **GROW-001** — Sub-struct grouping. Trigger: >25 World fields. Currently 8.
- **GROW-002** — Phase function grouping. Trigger: >30 system calls. Currently 5.
- **GROW-003** — System dependency analyzer. Trigger: >15 system files. Currently 5.

## Tier 1 — Ecosystem Sustainability

- **SIM-001** — Plant growth system (Phase 1). Food sources regenerate over time. Without this, world depletes and everything dies.
- **SIM-002** — Thirst system (Phase 2). Structurally identical to hunger. Requires water tiles on map.
- **SIM-003** — Decay system (Phase 1). Corpses decompose, tiles recycle. Prevents dead entity clutter.

## Tier 2 — Behavioral Depth

- **SIM-004** — Tiredness/sleep system (Phase 2). Third need axis. Rest creates vulnerability windows and scheduling.
- **SIM-005** — Injury system (Phase 5). Damage produces injury states instead of binary alive/dead.
- **SIM-006** — Weather system (Phase 1). Rain/drought/cold affect temperature, plant growth, mood.

## Tier 3 — Social & Emergent Complexity

- **SIM-007** — Emotions/mood system (Phase 2). Aggregates needs, injuries, weather, social inputs. Feeds decisions.
- **SIM-008** — Relationships system (Phase 5). Repeated interactions build bonds. Cooperation, grudges, groups.
- **SIM-009** — Reputation system (Phase 5). Observed behavior builds rep. Emergent social structure.

## Tier 4 — World Manipulation

- **SIM-010** — Building system (Phase 4). Requires inventory and decision expansion.
- **SIM-011** — Crafting system (Phase 4). Requires recipes and inventory.
- **SIM-012** — Fluid flow system (Phase 1). Cellular automaton for water. Lowest priority.
