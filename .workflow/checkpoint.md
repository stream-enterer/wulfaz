# Checkpoint

## Active Task
None — Phase UI-1 quality pass complete

## Completed This Session
- Quality pass on Phase UI-1 (UI-100 through UI-108)
  - Fixed clip_rect propagation in Row/Column/ScrollList layout (was only propagated in generic path)
  - Added Rect::intersect() for proper clip intersection
  - Implemented zoom-to-cursor (UI-107 spec compliance — zoom centers on mouse position)
  - Added 14 edge-case tests (Row/Column zero/single/all-percent, wrap edge cases, clip intersection/propagation, GameDate multi-year/mid-month)

## Phase UI-1 Status
All 9 items complete + quality pass applied
